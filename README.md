This is joint work with Sarah Jones of Clemson involving the _data processing_ of TDMS files.

---

The tdms_csv.py uses the function *as_dataframe* which is only available in the development version (as of 23 Feb 2015) of the npTDMS library.  This can be installed by typing the following into a terminal: 

pip install https://github.com/adamreeve/npTDMS/zipball/master
